Welcome to my custom homepage project! This is a simple, yet aesthetically pleasing HTML page designed to be set as your browser's homepage, offering a quick overview of useful links, current date/time, and upcoming anime episodes.
Features

    Clean and Modern Design: A sleek interface with a focus on usability.

    Dynamic Backgrounds: The background image changes randomly on each page load, providing a fresh look every time.

    Quick Access Links: Organized sections for Entertainment, Proactive, Miscellaneous, and Utilities.

    Anime Episode Tracker: Displays upcoming anime episodes for the Summer 2025 season (or easily customizable for other seasons/shows).

    Beginner-Friendly: Easy to install and modify, even if you're new to HTML.

Here's a sneak peek at what it looks like:

Installation

Getting this custom homepage up and running is straightforward:

    Download index.html: Download the index.html file from this repository.

    Secure Location: Place the index.html file in a secure and easily accessible location on your file explorer (e.g., your Documents folder, a dedicated "Homepage" folder, etc.).

    Copy File Path: Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge). Once opened, copy the full path displayed in your browser's address bar. It should look something like file:///C:/Users/YourUser/Documents/homepage/index.html (the exact path will vary based on your operating system and where you saved the file).

    Set as Custom Homepage:

        Go to your browser's settings.

        Look for the "Homepage" or "On startup" section.

        Select the option to set a custom homepage and paste the file path you copied in the previous step.

        Save your changes.

Now, every time you open your browser or a new tab, your custom homepage will greet you!
Customization (Beginner Friendly!)

This project is designed with beginners in mind. If you're not very well-versed in coding HTML, don't worry! You can easily customize this file:

    Use Google Gemini: Drop the index.html file into Google Gemini (or a similar AI assistant) and ask it to change, add, or remove anything you need. For example, you can ask it to:

        "Change the 'Entertainment' links to point to my favorite streaming services."

        "Add a new section for 'Work Links' with specific URLs."

        "Remove the 'Miscellaneous' section."

        "Update the anime episodes for the current season."

Known Issue: Background Repeatability

While the background image changes randomly on each start, leading to a fresh look, please note that repeatability can sometimes be an issue. You might occasionally see the same image appear in quick succession.
