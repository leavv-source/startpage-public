## Installation

Getting this custom homepage up and running is straightforward. Follow these steps:

1.  **Download `index.html`**: Download the `index.html` file from this repository to your local machine.

2.  **Secure Location**: Place the `index.html` file in a secure and easily accessible location on your file explorer (e.g., your `Documents` folder, a dedicated "Homepage" folder, etc.).

3.  **Copy File Path**: Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge). Once opened, **copy the full path displayed in your browser's address bar**. It should look something like `file:///C:/Users/YourUser/Documents/homepage/index.html` (the exact path will vary based on your operating system and where you saved the file).

4.  **Set as Custom Homepage**:
    * Go to your browser's settings.
    * Look for the "**Homepage**" or "**On startup**" section.
    * Select the option to set a **custom homepage** and paste the file path you copied in the previous step.
    * Save your changes.

Now, every time you open your browser or a new tab, your custom homepage will greet you!

## Customization (Beginner Friendly!)

This project is designed with beginners in mind. If you're not very well-versed in coding HTML, don't worry! You can easily customize this file:

* **Use Google Gemini (or similar AI assistant)**: Drop the `index.html` file into Google Gemini (or a similar AI assistant) and ask it to change, add, or remove anything you need. For example, you can ask it to:
    * "Change the 'Entertainment' links to point to my favorite streaming services."
    * "Add a new section for 'Work Links' with specific URLs."
    * "Remove the 'Miscellaneous' section."
    * "Update the anime episodes for the current season."

## Known Issue: Background Repeatability

While the background image changes randomly on each start, leading to a fresh look, please note that repeatability can sometimes be an issue. You might occasionally see the same image appear in quick succession.
